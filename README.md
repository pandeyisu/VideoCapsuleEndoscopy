# VideoCapsuleEndoscopy
Monitoring the gastrointestinal (GI) tract at real time and in a safe and patient-friendly manner is important for the diagnosis and therapy of many GI diseases and the microbiota, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), inflammation, ulcers, and infections in the GI tract. This review paper surveys the latest progress in video capsule endoscopy (VCE) with a focus on engineering technologies for remote patient monitoring, micro-robotics, physiological sensing, GI nerve stimulation, fluid sampling and drug delivery, panoramic imaging with adaptive frame rates, and rapid reading software.
